2. 9-axis IMU, Barometers (GY-91 sensor module)
3. 8 channel RC Transmitter/Receiver
4. GPS module

### Supported hardware
* GY-91 sensor module (SPI, MPU9250 [pin.9], BMP280 [pin.8])

### (Windows) Build ArduPilot for 86duino
Only ArduCopter had been tested on 86duino One.

1. Download the toolchain (https://github.com/roboard/86Ardupilot/releases/download/v1.0.0/toolchain.zip)
2. Run Ardupilot.bat (for setup environment)
3. Navigate to the ArduCopter source code folder (eg. C:\86ardupilot\ArduCopter\)
4. run "make 86duino -j4"

First time installation:
Copy ArduCopter.exe (in ArduCopter folder) into the SD card, then rename it to _86duino.exe (replace the original one).
	
Upload firmware by usb connection(for developer):
1. Run Ardupilot.bat
2. Navigate to the Tools folder (eg. C:\86ardupilot\Tools\86duino)
3. run "upx ..\\..\ArduCopter\ArduCopter.exe"
4. run "v86dude com'N' 20 ..\\..\ArduCopter\ArduCopter.exe standalone" ('N' is the usb comport number)
